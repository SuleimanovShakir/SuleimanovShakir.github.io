<div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Avenir">Hi! My name is Shakir Suleimanov and I'm a bioinformatician. I graduated from First Moscow State Medical University (Sechenov University) in 2023 and currently, I am doing my Masters at Skoltech. During my education at Sechenov University, I have participated in several projects aimed at studying the biology of innate immune cells under the supervision of Irina Vlasova, Ph.D. (Sechenov University).</span></div>
<br>
<div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Avenir">Further, I switched to bioinformatics and my current research interest lies in the field of single-cell biology of immune cells. Currently I'm working on several projects:
  
  - CITE-seq data analysis of patients with rheumatoid arthritis under the supervision of Sergey Sennikov (Sechenov University).
  - Study of TILs biology in tumor microenvironment context using sungle-cell transcriptomics under supervision of Dmitry Chudakov (Skoltech).
  - Automatization of quality control steps for immune repertoire sequencing data using Python/R under supervision of Mikhail Myshkin (MiLaboratories). </span></div>
<br>
<div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Avenir">Last year I studied at the Bioinformatics Institute and currently I continue our work with Maxim Kholmatov (EMBL) on the problem of identification of empty droplets in combinatorially indexed single-cell RNA-seq data.</span></div>
<br>
<div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Avenir">Besides science, I love trekking, mountaineering and snowboarding. In my free time, I love playing the guitar!</span></div>
