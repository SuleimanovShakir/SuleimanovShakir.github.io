Hi everyone! 

My name is Shakir Suleimanov, and I'm a bioinformatician. 

Currently, I am a **[RESPIRE-EXCEL](https://www.respire-excel.eu)** MSCA Doctoral Network PhD Student. Under supervision of **[Martijn Nawijn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2c19wW4AAAAJ&hl=en)** (UMCG) and **[Malte Lücken](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Nr4KBvUAAAAJ&hl=en)** (Helmholtz Munich) I work on integrating single-cell and single-nuc data into reference atlas for COPD and asthma to explore disease-associated shared and unique cell states and trajectories.

Additionally, I work at the **[Bioinformatics Institute](https://bioinf.institute)** as a teaching assistant for the Statistics and R course and the Machine Learning course, and I am also a mentor in the **[Sci.STEPS](https://www.scisteps.org)** mentoring program.

I did my MD in First Moscow State Medical University (Sechenov University) in 2023 and my MSc in Life Science at Skoltech at 2025.

During my studies at Sechenov University, I have participated in several projects aimed at studying the biology of innate immune cells, presumably neutrophils and macrophages under the supervision of **Irina Vlasova**, Ph.D. (Sechenov University). I have started in the lab from scratch and during my work, I mastered working protocols for neutrophils analysis and established wet-lab protocol for monocyte-macrophage differentiation.

Further, I switched to bioinformatics and my current research interest lies in the field of single-cell biology. During my studies, I've been working on several projects (more information is on projects page):
  
  * CITE-seq data analysis of patients with rheumatoid arthritis under the supervision of **[Sergey Sennikov](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Sergey-V-Sennikov-Lab)** (Sechenov University).
  * Study of TILs biology in tumor microenvironment (NSCLC) using single-cell transcriptomics under supervision of **[Dmitry Chudakov](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=eJPnGEEAAAAJ&hl=en)** (Skoltech).
  * Automatization of quality control steps for immune repertoire sequencing data using Python/R under supervision of **Mikhail Myshkin** (MiLaboratories).
  * Problem of identification of empty droplets in combinatorially indexed single-cell RNA-seq data **Maxim Kholmatov** (Bioinformatics Institute)

Besides science, I love trekking, mountaineering and traveling. In my free time, I love playing different sports and guitar!
