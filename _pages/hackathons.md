#### **Benchmarking file formats and data engines on TCR repertoire overlaps**

This presentation introduces a benchmarking project centered on efficient processing of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data, particularly focusing on calculating overlaps using the Jaccard index. With modern biological datasets reaching large scales, optimizing file formats and data engines is crucial. The study explores the use of CSV and Parquet formats, along with two processing engines—DuckDB and Polars—to handle and analyze immune repertoire data efficiently. The data is structured in two main formats: a concatenated form for row-wise records and a pivoted form optimized for direct overlap comparisons. The overall goal is to evaluate how different storage and processing choices affect performance in the context of high-throughput biological data analysis.  

#### **Methods for Differential Evaluation of Gene Regulatory Networks**

Aug 2024  
**Association for single cell analysis Workshop Hackathon**  
**Advisor**: Tychinin Dmitriy  

GRNs represent the complex interactions between transcription factors and their target genes, governing gene expression patterns in cells. Using scRNA-seq data from JRA patients and healthy controls, we applied the CellOracle package to reconstruct GRNs and assess differences between disease and healthy states. The project involved literature review, data filtering, GRN construction, and the development of custom heuristics to enhance the analysis. Various graph-based metrics, including centrality and graph similarity measures, were used to identify key regulatory changes. We have also introduces basic metrics comparing unique and common edges (TF-gene association) between states.
