#### **Methods for Differential Evaluation of Gene Regulatory Networks**

Aug 2024  
**Association for single cell analysis Workshop Hackathon**  
**Advisor**: Tychinin Dmitriy  

GRNs represent the complex interactions between transcription factors and their target genes, governing gene expression patterns in cells. Using scRNA-seq data from JRA patients and healthy controls, we applied the CellOracle package to reconstruct GRNs and assess differences between disease and healthy states. The project involved literature review, data filtering, GRN construction, and the development of custom heuristics to enhance the analysis. Various graph-based metrics, including centrality and graph similarity measures, were used to identify key regulatory changes. We have also introduces basic metrics comparing unique and common edges (TF-gene association) between states.
